dontbug record
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The 'dontbug record' command records the execution of PHP scripts in the PHP built-in webserver [1] or
in the PHP command line interpreter. This is used for later forward/reverse debugging in a PHP IDE.
A typical workflow is to 'dontbug record' followed by 'dontbug replay'.

Syntax
------
    dontbug record <php-source-root-dir> [<docroot-dir>] [flags]
    dontbug record <php-source-root-dir> <php-script> --php-cli-script [args-in-quotes] [flags]

Examples
--------
    dontbug record /var/www/fancy-site docroot
    dontbug record /var/www/another-site

    dontbug record ~/php-test/ list-supported-functions.php --php-cli-script
    dontbug record ~/php-test/ math/calculate-factorial-min-max.php --php-cli-script --args "10 20"

The first example will spawn the PHP built-in webserver for recording the execution of "fancy-site"
website (as the user navigates various URLs in a browser). The docroot of the fancy site will be
/var/www/fancy-site/docroot and the <php-source-dir> will be /var/www/fancy-site

In general, dontbug will be able to handle any PHP framework/CMS as long you meet its minimum requirements
and the framework/CMS runs in PHP's built in webserver (most of them should). Here the PHP built in webserver
is substituting for Apache, Nginx etc.

The second example is like the first. Here the <docroot-dir> is assumed to be the same as the
<php-source-root-dir>.

The third example will record the execution of ~/php-test/list-supported-functions.php

The fourth example will record the execution of a PHP script with two arguments 10 and 20 passed to it.
Note the quotes to enclose the arguments. The script's full path is ~/php-test/math/calculate-factorial-min-max.php

As you have seen _if_ you specify <docroot-dir> or <php-script> then it should specified as a *relative* path
w.r.t to the <php-source-root-dir>.

The <php-source-root-dir> means the outermost directory of all possible PHP scripts that might be executed
in this project by PHP sources in this project.

Note:
(1) Typically <php-source-root-dir> would be the docroot in your PHP project or, sometimes its parent folder.

<php-source-root-dir> is not the same as <docroot-dir>, sometimes, as scripts might be placed outside the docroot
in some PHP projects e.g. vendor scripts installed by composer. Please keep this directory as specific as possible.
For example, you _could_ specify "/" (the root directory) as <php-source-root-dir> as it
contains all the possible PHP scripts on your system. But this would impact performance hugely.

(2) If you have sources symlinked from inside the <php-source-root-dir> to outside that dir, dontbug should be
able to handle that (without you having to increase the scope of the <php-source-root-dir>)

PHP built-in webserver tips
---------------------------
You may record as many http page loads for later debugging when running the PHP built in webserver
(unlike traditional PHP debugging which is usually one page load at a time). However be aware that
recording too many page loads may degrade performance during debugging. Additionally, you
may _not_ pass arguments to the PHP built-in webserver i.e. the --args flag is ignored if not used in
conjunction with --php-cli-script.

Config file
-----------
If you find that you are frequently passing the same flags to dontbug, you may provide custom config for
various flags in a $HOME/.dontbug.yaml file. Sample file:

server-port: 8003
install-location: /some-path/src/github.com/sidkshatriya/dontbug

Most of the parameters defaults should suffice and you will typically need a very minimal .dontbug.yaml config file.

Flags passed via command line will always override any configuration in a .yaml file. If the .yaml
file and user flags don't specify a particular parameter, the defaults mentioned in
'dontbug record --help' will apply.
