Dontbug Debugger version 0.1
Dontbug is a reversible debugger for PHP

dontbug replay
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The 'dontbug replay' command replays a previously saved execution trace to a PHP IDE debugger. You
may set breakpoints, step through code, inspect variable values etc. as you are used to. But more interestingly,
dontbug allows you to *reverse* debug i.e. step over backwards, run backwards, hit breakpoints when running in
reverse and so forth.

dontbug communicates with PHP IDEs by using the dbgp protocol which is the defacto standard for PHP IDEs
so *no special support* is required for dontbug to work with them. As far as the IDEs are concerned
they are talking with a normal PHP debug engine.

Basic Usage
-----------
- Record an execution by using 'dontbug record' (see 'dontbug record --help' to know how to do this)
- Ask your PHP IDE to listen for a debugging connection
- In your favorite shell, execute:

    $ dontbug replay

- Dontbug now tries to connect to the PHP IDE that is listening for debugger connections
- Once connected, dontbug will replay the last execution recorded (via 'dontbug record') to the IDE
- Once connected, use the debugger in the IDE as you would, normally
- If you want run in reverse mode, press "r" for reverse mode and "f" for forward mode in the dontbug
  prompt. In reverse mode the buttons in your IDE will remain the same but they will have the reverse effect
  when you press them: e.g. Step Over will now be reverse Step Over and so forth.
- Press h for help on dontbug prompt for more information

Tips, Gotchas
-------------
Some PHP IDEs will try to open a browser window when they start listening for debug connections. Let them do that.
The URL they access in the browser is likely to result in an error anyways. Ignore the error. This has absolutely
no effect on dontbug as we're replaying a previously saved execution trace but the IDE does not know that.

The only important thing is to look for a message in green "dontbug: Connected to PHP IDE debugger" on the dontbug
prompt. Once you see this message, you can start debugging in your PHP IDE as you normally would. Except you now
have the ability to run in reverse when you want.

Remember that replays are frozen in time. If you change your PHP code after a replay, you will need to do
'dontbug record' again. If you don't do that 'dontbug replay' will replay a PHP execution corresponding to an
**earlier version** of the source code while your PHP IDE will show the current PHP source code!
This can lead to a lot of confusion (and weird behavior) as you may imagine.

Essentially, you need make sure that your PHP sources are _not_ newer than the last recording. If they are, you should
simply 'dontbug record' again. (There is an advanced/experimental flag --take-snapshot which allows you to record an
execution _and_ take a source code snapshot so that the above issue can be dealt with in a more principled way.
However, this feature is currently undocumented and increases the complexity of your workflow. Therefore: simply do a
'dontbug record' again if your PHP sources have changed since the last recording!).
